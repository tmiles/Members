#### Andrew Young - Toronto, ON
##### UVSA Ontario

  1. Being able to invest time and effort into building something - automating processes or tying things together - to ultimately benefit as many people as possible.
  2. Contributing my knowledge and experience, and also learning from others, to fully leverage technology and bring UNAVSA (and our respective groups) to the next plateau.
  3. I look forward to collaborating with everyone. I live and breathe code and it is definitely a passion of mine that I've turned into a career as a contractor/freelancer.

#### Michael Vu - Toronto, ON
##### UTVSA (Toronto)

  1. I like digital technology because it has created a new space for building and experimentation, and this space is still growing and figuring out its possibilities, unlike other equally interesting spaces such as carpentry or painting. Last year I went to a Hackathon at U of Toronto and it was a really cool experience!
  2. I am looking to learn from this group because although I am extremely interested in this field my background is quite weak (only some basic Python, and some experience with Adobe Creative Suite). Because my background is in neuroscience, my secret plan is to acquire new skills in the hopes of creating new ways for our minds to interact with digital technology, such as through EEG-controllers. That being said I also want to contribute however I can to the jobs that need to be done within UNAVSA!
  3. It's kind of lame, but when I saw the movie "The Social Network" in theatres me and my friend had a long inspiring discussion afterwards which I think changed the way I think about the trajectory of my life. I think that digital technology is exciting for many people in that respect, it promises a kind of limitless wild west of potential, which of course is kind of overblown, but anyways it is empowering and motivating to enter this space. Also, "The Social Network" official soundtrack is amazing I recommmend it!
  
#### Jennifer Nghe - Nanuet, NY/Boston, MA
##### New England IVSA and Boston University VSA

   1. Technological advancements make the world go round. The possibilities are endless!
   2. I'm always down to learn new things.
   3. This sounds like something we could add to VSAcademy.

#### Roger Le - Austin, TX
##### UNAVSA, UVSASouth, UTVSA, UTAVSA
   1. I love how you can leave a legacy by writing good software that keeps on giving back to your target audience
   2. Looking forward to connecting with other aspiring technologists and collaborate in exchanging ideas and code and opportunities for one another to showcase each others skills and develop each other.
   3. It will be fun building apps with you guys and gals that could benefit UNAVSA and add them to our portfolios as well as exchange best practices and network with individuals in the UNAVSA for my and your ideal position!


#### Brian Nguyen- Houston, TX
##### UNAVSA/UH VSA/VSA South

  1. It is constantly changing and is an integral part of our lives.
  2. To learn more about coding and to improve my feeble coding skills.
  3. I'm excited to learn from this group, and I feel that this group will teach me more on coding than I have in my past year of coding at school.

testing ifft integration. When Pull request, post to Facebook!
